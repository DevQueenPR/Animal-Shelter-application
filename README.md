# Animal-Shelter-application

During my internship, I gained hands-on experience in software development, focusing on designing user-friendly interfaces that ensured clarity and engagement while aligning with project goals. I built and maintained back-end systems using MySQL and BBj (Basis), guaranteeing efficient system functionality and seamless data management. Additionally, I developed software capable of transferring data in various formats, facilitating interoperability and data exchange across different platforms.

I contributed to two key projects:

Medical Software Development: Programmed a system for medication distribution and classification based on patient records, discontinuation status, expiration dates, and other relevant data, improving tracking and organization within the company.

Business-Oriented Application Development: Designed a BBj-based application that simulated real-world business operations, including an animal shelter management system that integrated core functionalities for effective process handling.

I worked on CRUD operations, ensuring efficient database interactions and system behavior. I implemented Regex-based validations for data integrity and dynamic controls for optimized workflows. User experience was enhanced through confirmation messages, feedback mechanisms, and role-based access controls.

Additionally, I developed structured PDF reports with structured headers, timestamps, logos, and dynamic titles with automated processes with a BAT file, and integrated email functionalities with validation for accurate formatting and confirmations.

To improve data presentation, I optimized HTML structures with dynamic URL changes and custom XML tags for structured records. I also created interactive HTML reports with styled tables and essential data points, along with reset functionality for efficient field clearing and exit controls for seamless application closure.
